# Instructions to install Google plugin for Cloudera Director.

Detailed information about plugin installation, and about the plugins that come pre-installed, is part of the Cloudera Director documentation. This section contains only an overview, and concentrates on information of interest to hot patch plugin authors.

Cloudera Director contains a directory for plugins. The user creates a subdirectory for each plugin. This subdirectory contains the plugin jar and an etc directory for additional filesystem-based plugin configuration information. Cloudera Altus Director will create an empty etc directory if it is absent.

A plugin author may want to provide an archive file which mirrors this structure and provides sample or starter configuration files in the nested configuration directory.

## Installing the plugin
Clone this git project and then move the jar file to the appropriate Director Google plugin location. 

Follow the following steps or DIY. 
Depending on what version of Director is installed your Google plugin directory will have a different version. In this example I am using Director 6.2.1 and the google plugin directory is /var/lib/cloudera-director-plugins/google-provider-2.0.3/


## Install git if its not installed already
sudo yum install git

### Get enhanced Director from Git.
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/purn1mak/ClouderaDirector.git

## Move jar file to google provider location.
cd /var/lib/cloudera-director-plugins/google-provider-2.0.3/  
sudo cp ~/ClouderaDirector/google-provider-2.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar .   
sudo mv google-provider-2.0.3.jar ~/.   
sudo mv google-provider-2.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar google-provider-2.0.3.jar   


## Stop Director
sudo service cloudera-director-server stop

## Start Director
sudo service cloudera-director-server start
